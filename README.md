# tensorflow experiments - a series of experiments, written in C++

This repo contains a collection of smaller Tensorflow experiments, written
with the intent to be utilized in a number of different C++ projects.

Currently at this time it does not contain much in the way of code,
but feel free to fork it and use it for other projects if you find it
useful.


# Requirements

The following is needed in order for this to function as intended:

* GCC 7.0+ 
* Tensorflow 1.2+

Older versions could still give some kind of result, but I *think* most of
the newer versions of Tensorflow require newer versions of GCC. Feel free
to email me if this is incorrect.


# Installation

Simply clone this repo into your project and include the relevant headers
into your project.
